                   <span>We acknowledge that this decentralized organization was created and operates on occupied ancestral, traditional and contemporary lands of Indigenous nations. 
                        We recognize the ongoing impact of colonization and the ongoing struggles of Indigenous peoples. We understand that digital inequity has the ability to increase the existing socio-economic gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. We are commited to work towards building regenerative practices to support decolonization. This comes from the important understanding that sustainable systems include all of the land, air, water, soil and culturally important plant, animal and fungi species that have sustained Indigenous peoples over thousands of years. In contrast to the industrial, linear production systems we have today, traditional Indigenous systems we're based on regenerative practices within boundaries that respect the planet.

<span>What is Hibiscus DAO?</span>
<p>Hibiscus DAO is building the first transparent, open-source, community-owned toolkit for the fashion creator economy.
</p>
<p>We're rethinking clothing production with 3 goals in mind:
</p>
<li>1. Build a decentralized apparel brand via community-curated collections.</li>
<li>2. Create “Fashion Legos” = a "Github for Garments" to open-source apparel production.</li>
<li>3. Enable the “fashion creator economy” = help creators and makers own the means of production + retain the value they create via cryptographic profit distribution systems.</li>

<li>
    <h1>Immediate Roadmap</h1>
</li>
<span>“Merch as a gateway drug to design for diversity”</span>
<p> 

Creating a humane on-chain, full-service garment production system is a huge endeavor - so we’re using "merch" production as a testing ground for our protocol + returning ownership to makers.
</p>

<li>
    <h1>Key ideas to work on immediately bringing to life:</h1>
</li>
<li>1. Build “Fashion Legos”: a garment library that serves an open-source, Github-like platform for apparel production: Create open source, end-to-end apparel production supply chain + tech infrastructure that allows creators to easily create new garments on existing bases.</li>


<img src="https://arweave.net/z76dtLv41R8QmadlPVl1ZvaaKZuo3punVopeP_8wsJQ" alt="Web3 Community Merch Ecosystem">

2. Cultivate a repository of designers, producers, and suppliers who have successfully used our core garment library protocol: </br>

This gives our protocol network effects - making it even easier for new projects to create apparel by forking and building on top of existing on-chain portfolios - which include garments, materials, and designs.
Split system for community contributors.

Figure out how to retain and redistribute the value created in making and wearing apparel via cryptographic profit sharing.
Produce the first community-curated collection.

Leverage in-house production supply chain + tech infrastructure to release Hibiscus’s first community-curated collection - becoming a decentralized apparel brand in the process.
